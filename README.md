# FAAGrantData

This is data from the FAA Airport Improvement Program that is used for Alteryx Demonstrations. 

It is not the complete data that the FAA publishes. The complete data can be found here:
https://www.faa.gov/airports/aip/

There is another set of data that is used to decode the airport identifiers in the file. It is also not the complete set, but what we need for our purposes. The complete set is updated roughly monthly (a 28-day update cycle), and is available here:
